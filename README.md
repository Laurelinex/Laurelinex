As a [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/courses/professional-software-development/) graduate in Professional Software Development (+ with a level 8 PDA in Software Development), an intensive professional programming course, I gained a thorough grounding in full stack development, including APIs, server side technologies, JavaScript frameworks, TDD, OOP, and more. The main projects I completed during the course are the [Glasgow Bucket](https://github.com/Laurelinex/GlasgowBucket), [Farkle](https://github.com/Laurelinex/Farkle) and [fooDee](https://github.com/Laurelinex/fooDee).
